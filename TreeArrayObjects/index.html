    <h1>Fall is Coming!</h1>
    <p>
      I modified the "TreeArrayObjects" example to include:
      <ul>
        <li>Branch widths calculated using a decaying exponential
        model based on branch generation.</li>
        <li>Branch angles and lengths are set within various random
          ranges to give a more realistic tree-like structure.</li>
        <li>Leaves which change from green to a random color between
          yellow and red.</li>
        <li>When a leaf reaches its final color it falls to the ground.</li>
        <li>As the leaf falls it is affected by a Perlin noise wind.</li>
        <li>The leaves collect on the ground.</li>
      </ul>
